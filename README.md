# Pong Clone using Love2D
The repository contains a Pong clone created using Love2D. As of now, all of the source code has been copied by from the course CS50's Intro to Game Dev. The code and this README.md file will be updated regularly as I progress through the course and learn new content. 
The final version of Pong will have a menu, sprites, and other features, as well as a proper file structure, Game States, and an executable file.
